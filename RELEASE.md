## Release 1.0.0 - 07/22/2023

For the initial relase, users will be able to create a personal profile to organize connections and activity such as friends and message feeds. There will be an interface to view nearby pickleball courts and the associated information (Directions to the court, ratings, meet times, etc.). Every user will have the ability to upload his/her own courts if they are not already in the database. Aside from the message feed, users will be able to contact one another with live messaging.
